PennApps Courses API
====================

... more to come ...

To-do
-----
* Fix up search (the view doesn't work)
* Documentation! (that is this)
* A way for the upload script to update (or even replace?) existing courses as appropriate
* Make separation between parsing and importing more explicit (separate classes/files)
* Add semester to individual course view
* Fix import script when there are more than 3 meeting times (hi Arabic department, why don't you follow a normal format?)
* Show course-code (i.e., CIS-110) in department page 
* Fix import script to not tag prerequisites as crosslists
