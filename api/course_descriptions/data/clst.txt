Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage in the face of adversity.  Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem to like to hear them?  This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as well as a few contemporary American ones, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations.  We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths.  Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture?  Are they entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over?  Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? \n\nInvestigate these questions through a variety of topics creation of the universe between gods and mortals, religion and family, sex,love, madness, and death.\n\n(One-term course offered either term.)", "title": "100.

In the generation that followed, Athens rapidly transformed the alliance of Greek states dedicated to taking the war back to Persia into an Aegean empire, dominated b y the Athenians and their fleet.  At the same time, this dramatic in power and prestige was accompnaied by the growth of fill participatory democracy.  We examine the daily working of that democracy, asking how an Athenian was trained for citizenship.  What did democracy mean in practice? What did freedom and autinomy mean to a society that relied on slaves and was ruthless in its treatment of its subject?  In order to answer these questions we juxtapose the breathtaking accomplishments of the Athenians, in fields such as philosophy, tragedy, comedy, sculpture and architecture, with the exclusion of women from public life, the torture and abuse of slaves, and the execution of other Greek populations. \n\n We will follow them from the height of their power to defeat at the hands of the Spartans.

We will also look at how the earlier and later Middle Ages differentiated between \"primary\" and \"advanced\" education, how children and childhood are represented in educational discourse, how women participate in (or are figured in) intellectual discourse (Eloise, Hildegard of Bingen, Christine de Pizan), how universities changed ideas of intellectual formation, and how vernacular learning in the later Middle Ages added yet another dimension to the representation of learning. \n\n Among the later texts to be covered will be Abelards's\"Historica Calamitatum,\" John of Salisbury's \"Metalogicon,\" selections from Aquinas and other university masters, Jean de Meun's \"Roman de la Rose,\" Christine de Pizan's \"Chemin de Long Estude,\" Gower's \"Confessio Amantis\" (book 7), and possibly selections from Dante's \"Convivio.\" \n\n Students from all disciplines across the humanities are welcome.  Classicts are encouraged to enroll, as well as, of course, medievalists and early modernists.  Readings will all be available in English translation, but many of the readings can be done in the original languages (Latin, Old French or Middle French, Italian) as students wish (on an individualor collective basis).  Class discussions, however, will always have reference to available translations.  One seminar paper (15+ pages) will be required, along with (probably) one report.\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "418. (COML510, ENGL524) Medieval Education.

(M) Copeland. \n\nThis course takes Chaucer's uses of antiquity as a point of entry into questions about the ancient lineages of medieval literary and intellectual culture.  The coverage of Chaucer's writings in relation to classical and late classical authors will be quite substantial.  We will survey the medieval textual histories of Virgil, Ovid, Horace, Statius,and Boethius as they materialize in specific Chaucerian sites, including: \"Troilus and Criseyde\", \"Knight's Tale\". \"Legend of Good Women\", \"House of Fame\" (and perhaps one other dream poem), \"Boece\",and Nun's Priets's Tale\".These texts are sites for opening broader inquiries about the uses of antiquity in the Middle Ages: medieval transformations of ancient theories of narrative, of allegory and allegoresis, and of hermeneutics, translation, and invention; medieval receptions of ancient pedagogical discourses (including how classical authors were used in medieval schooling) and reconfigurations of ancient systems of knowledge; and medieval assimilations of ancient intellectual currents (Platonisms,scientific epistemologies,theories of language and signification). To these ends we will also look at various late classical expositors who mediated many of these problems to the Middle Ages, including Fulgentius, Martianus Capella, Marcrobius, Priscian, and St.  Augustine. \n\n This seminar will be designed to address the interests of two constituencies: classicists who want to know more about the medeival fortunes of ancient traditions; and medievalists and early modernists,for whose ongoing research the long diachronic structure of this course can offer a good foundation.  The course is designed to accomodate the particular expertise that classicists can bring to study of post-classical literary history.  For non-classicists considering the course, knowledge of Latin isn't a requirement, but it is certainly helpful.  Readings of Chaucer will be in Middle English.  Course texts will include The Riverside Chaucer, Loeb editions of Horace and Boethius, a photocopied packet of promary and seconadry readings, and possibly some paperback English translations of late classical sources (e. g. Macrobius).  Requirements will consist of one research paper and (depending on size of the class) one or two brief discussion presentations.\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "610.

In particular, controversy has surrounded the extent to which the economies of Greco-Roman antiquity can be modeled using contemporary tools of analysis.  In recent scholarship, many of the tenets laid down by Moses Finley in his The Ancient Economy have been re-evaluated, with the result that the field is currently in a state of intellectual ferment.  It is the purpose of this course to explore the terms in which contemporary debates over ancient economic systems are formulated, with reference to a variety of societies and periods, from the palace economies of the Mycenaean period to the system of taxation introduced in the early fourth century by the emperor Diocletian and his colleagues in the Tetrarchy.\n\n(One-term course offered either term.)", "title": "616.

(M) Copeland. \n\nThis course takes the great kaleidoscopic poem Piers Plowman as its ostensible subject and point of departure for thinking about the literary cultures in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth century, as well as their continuity with older and indeed later literary and intellectual discourses.  The cultural lens of Piers Plowman takes in a fascinating range of social and historical categories, including the political (political organization, rebellion, state formation, labor, law, reforms); language (Latin and vernacular, literacy, mixing of dialect, registers, rhetorical modalities, and genres); religion (orthodoxy and heterodoxy, piety, apocalypticism, spiritual \"literacies\") geography (from pilgrimage to fantasy to agricultural labor); intellectual histories; and the very status of textuality itself. \n\n In considering these problems we will read a variety of Piers intertexts, including selections from penitential manuals, Lollard sermons and trial records, treatises on translation, rebel broadsides, radical knock-off versions of Piers Plowman such as Piers the Plowmans Creed and Mum and Sothsegger, and selections from better known works such as The Book of Margery Kempe and Chaucers Parliament of Fowls.  We will also make use of earlier Latin and continental materials (in English translation) that illuminate the intellectual traditions on which Piers Plowman draws. \n\nRequirements will include two oral presentations and a final paper.
