They talked about the weather and had sex, they had to deal with cold, hunger, illness, epidemics and natural catastrophes.  Those fortunate few who could afford the luxury, went to local monastic schools and learned how to read and write.

Yet two people who speak different languages have a difficult time talking to one another, unless they both know a third, common language or can find someone who knows both their languages to translate what they want to say.  Without translation, most of us would not be able to read the Bible or Homer, the foundations of Western culture.

Categories such as the cute, the sentimental, the miniature, kitsch, and camp will be explored.

This course investigates texts by contemporary \"German\" authors with diverse roots, who live in between countries, cultures, heritages,traditions and languages.

Each author differently questions issues of nationhood and nationality and challenges traditional notions of what it means to be \"German\" and living in today's Germany.  Through the critical reading of their colorful prose, you deepen your understanding of the complexities of global citizenry and look into fixed categories of identity formation.  In addition, you break open stereotypical imaginations of what German literature entails.  The course has two particular areas of concentration: Turkey and the European Union.

Bracing-and-often confrontational-dialogues between theoretical and political positions as varied as Deconstruction.  New Historicism, Cultural Materialism, Feminism, Queer Theory, Minority Discourse Theory, Colonial and Post-colonial Studies and Cultural Studies have, in particular, altered disciplinary agendas and intellectual priorities for students embarking on the /professional / study of literature.

We will also investigate several theoretical models which can help us to think through the cultural encounters documented in the primary works.

Who lives in the East and how are the \"customs and manners\" of its inhabitants comprehended?  What happens to a German in the East?  And, vice versa, what happens to an \"Oriental\" in Germany?
