We will make a concerted effort to view these interpretive approaches not only historically but also through the lens of contemporary critical and hermeneutical theory in order to examine their contemporary relevance to literary interpretation and the use that some modern literary theorists (e.g. Bloom, Kermode, Derrida, Todorov) have made of these ancient exegetes and their methods.

All readings and lectures in English. \n\nIn recent years, studies of memory (both individual and cultural) have rivaled those of history, and have produced alternative narratives of events.  At the same time, research has also focused on the rupture of narrative, the inability to find appropriate forms of telling, and the experience of a loss of words.  The notion of trauma (Greek for \"wound\") may stand for such a rupture.  Many kinds of narratives, most prominently the recollections of Holocaust survivors, are instances in which memories are invoked not only to come to terms with traumatic events, but also to inscribe trauma in various ways.  In this seminar, we will read theoretical work on memory and trauma, discuss their implication for the study of literature, art, and culture, read select examples from Holocaust survivors' autobiographies (i.e.  Primo Levi, EliWiesel), and discuss visual art (i.e.  Boltanski, Kiefer) and film (i.e. Resnais, Lanzmann, Spielberg).\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "540.

Taking Primo Levi as a focal point, the first part of the course will center on his work.  Through the study of a range of texts drawn from different genres, using memoir, fiction, poetry, and historiography, we will consider major aspects such as incarceration in Auschwitz, the annihilation of the personality versus the \"liberation\" of poetic expression, linguistic plurality, miscomprehension as a basis for condemnation and death, the language of violence as a universal language and the jargon of the camps.  Analysis of these themes will lead us to consider such issues as the drama of survival and the inadequacy of the therapy of writing.  We will also look at other intellectuals, among them Jean Amery, who wrote about their experiences in the concentration camps, from the perspective of the question of limits of intellect and his theory of suicide. We will contrast the experience of Levi and Amery with that of Paul Celan.
