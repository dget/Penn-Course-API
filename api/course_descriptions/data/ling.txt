Contacts between groups of people speaking different languages, motivated by trade, migration, conquest and intermarriage, are documented from earliest records.  At the same time, differences in socio- historical context have created different kinds of linguistic outcomes.  Some languages have been completely lost; new languages have been created.  In still other cases, the nature and structure of language has been radically altered.  The course introduces the basics of linguistic structure through a discussion of which aspects of language have proved to be relatively stable, and which are readily altered, under conditions of bilingualism.\n\n(Course offered in fall term only.)", "title": "054.
