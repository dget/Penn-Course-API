How can economic and sociological approaches be combined in explanatory models of demography change?  How does immigration to the US affect the ethnic composition of the population, the earnings of native workers, taxes on natives, and the macro-economy?  What causes the aging of populations, and how will population aging affect the economies of industrial nations, and in particular, pension programs like Social Security?  What accounts for the rise in women's participation in the wage labor force over the past century?  How are family composition and poverty interrelated?
