Our goal is to distinguish valid and invalid arguments by purely formal means.  As opposed to the analysis of deductive reasoning carried out in the first part of the course, in the second part we shall concentrate on inductive reasoning.

An agent-based model is a tool used by social scientists to study how large-scale social dynamics result from micro-level individual behavior.  In its basic form, a collection of individuals, or agents, are programmed into a computer, along with a simple behavioral algorithm describing how they act.  The computer then allows the agents to interact (possibly in both space and time), and ultimately generates a social dynamic that can then be analyzed in terms of the behavioral rules. \n\n In the social sciences many problems we are interested in involve group phenomena that may seem perplexing when viewed in the aggregate.  Examples include fads, norms, segregation, stereotyping, and network formation.  The goal of an agent-based model is to look at the micro-level decisions that people make - the decision to live close to a friend, slow down to take a look at an accident, arrive early to the theater to get a good seat, or return a phone call - and study how these \"small\" decisions may have large and unintended consequences for society as a whole.\n\n(One-term course offered either term.)", "title": "320.
