We will survey the cancer literature through the lens of evolutionary and ecological theory and review how that theory does and does not apply to cancer biology.

Prerequisite(s): Equipment Prerequisite - IMPORTANT To accomodate an increasing demand for this class, we now require that all students bring a laptop to the lab sessions on Fridays.  TAs will provide help with the material, but you should be well- versed with your own laptop and should be willing/capable to download and install free software off the internet. \n\nThis course provides a board overview of bioinformatics and computational biology as applied to biomedical research. \n\nCourse material will be geared towards answering specific biological questions ranging from detailed analysis of a single gene through whole-genome analysis, transcriptional profiling, and systems biology.  The relevant principles underlying these methods will be addressed at a level appropriate for biologists without a background in computational sciences.  This course should enable students to integrate modern bioinformatics toold into their research program. \n\n Should I take this course?  This course will emphasize hands-on experience with application to current biological research problems.  However, it is not intended for computer science students who want to learn about biologically- motivated algorithmic problems; GCB/CIS/BIOL536 would be more appropriate for such individuals.  The course will assume a solid knowledge of modern biology. An advanced undergraduate course such as BIOL421 or a graduate course in biology such as BIOL526 (Experimental Principles in Cell and Molecular Biology), BIOL527 (Advanced Molecular Biology and Genetics), BIOL528 (Advanced Molecular Genetics), BIOL540 (Genetic Systems), or equivalent, is a prerequisite.\n\n(Course offered in fall term only.)", "title": "535.
