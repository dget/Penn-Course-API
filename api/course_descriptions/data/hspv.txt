(B) Henry. \n\nBuilding diagnostics pertain to the determination of the nature of a building's condition of performance and the identification of the corresponding causative pathologies by careful oberservation and investigation of its history, context and use.  Monitoring, a building diagnostic tool, is the consistent observation and recordation of a selected condition or attribute, by qualitative and/or quantitative measures over a period of time in order to generate useful information or data for analysis and presentation. Building diagnostics and monitoring allow the building professional to identify the causes and enabling factors or past or potential pathologies in a building and building systems, thus informing the development of buildings, the process informs the selection of interventions that satisfy the stewardship goals for cultural resource.\n\n(Course offered in spring term only.)", "title": "516.
