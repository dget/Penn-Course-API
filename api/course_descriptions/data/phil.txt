Most contemporary philosophers of language analyze meaning in terms of truth-conditional content: how the world would have to be for an assertion or other speech act to be satisfied.  But in many cases, it's unclear just what ontologically rrespectable facts could make our utterances true.  Further, much of our communicative activity appears to be aimed at affecting our iinterlocutors' hearts and actions as much as their minds.  If some aspects of conventional linguistic meaning involve the expression of evaluative or emotional attitudes rather than (just) truth-conditional content, how should a theory of meaning analyze this?  We'll begin with classic discussions of moral emotivism (e.g.  Ayer, Hare) and more recent versions of expressivism in ethics (e.g.  Gibbard, Blackburn), paying special attention to the Frege-Geach problem.  Next, we'll turn to recent discussions of epithets, especially racial slurs, in the philosophy of language (e.g.  Williamson, Brandom, Hornsby), tracing out similarities and contrasts with moral expressivism.

Undergraduates Need Permission. \n\nIn recent years, scholars in many different fields have shifted their attention to the problem of the treatment of combatants and detainees in times of war.  Revelations that the Bush Administration employed techniques against so- called \"non-enemy combatants\" that arguably violated the Geneva Conventions, as well as international and domestic laws against the use of torture, threw the legal community, as well as the public at large, into a heated debate about the permissible uses of torture in the war against terrorism and the efforts to enhance American security.  This course will examine the problems of crimes of war, and more specifically torture, from a jurisprudential perspective.  We will begin by considering the age-old debate in moral philosophy between the view that human beings have rights that cannot be overridden, and the view that all legal rules, including those governing conduct in war, should seek to optimize social utility, and that this principally requires a balancing of the costs and benefits of various courses of action.  After considering the foregoing general debate between \"deontologists,\" as they are called, and \"utilitarians,\" we will consider the growing literature on the clash of these perspectives that the Bush Administration faced in deciding whether to authorize harsh interrogation \n\n techniques to assist in the global war against terror.  In addition, we will consider such topics as the role of government lawyers in advising the government on the legality of its conduct.  What is the role morality of a lawyer in this position?  Does following the opinion of a government lawyer serve to immunize conduct of debatable legality? \n\nShould it, from a moral perspective?  We will also look more generally at the role of international law in protecting human rights.  One of the central arguments against the legality of torture bases itself on the idea that every human being has a set of rights with universal applicability, which rights are eo ipso violated when a human being, in whatever context, is made to suffer extreme physical and/or metal pain.  Are there good philosophical arguments for the existence of such rights?  If so, would the recognition of such rights provide a basis for universal prosecution for their violation?  Finally, is prosecution of rights-violators the best way, and most compelling way, to protect individuals against violations of their rights, or would such prosecutions be both questionable from a legal standpoint and ill- advised from a global political perspective?  In addition to the current debate about the techniques used in the Bush Administrative's war on terror, we will consider a number of \n\n historical examples, such as the prosecutions of Nuremberg, the prosecutions of the East German border guards, and the detention of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War.\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "577.

Undergraduates Need Permission. \n\nIn this seminar course, entitled Political Authority and Political Obligation, we will be examining, from a philosophical perspective, the related questions of whether and under what circumstances the state possesses the legitimate moral authority to govern, and whether and under what circumstances citizens possess a general moral obligation to obey the law.  Theorists often treat these two questions as though they are theoretically interchangeable, but, as we shall see, there are good reasons to doubt that this is so.  We will begin with Robert Paul Wolff's famous anarchist thesis that the state never has legitimate moral authority to govern, and, relatedly, that citizens never have a general obligation to obey the law.  We will then examine a number of well-known theories that claim to show that, under certain circumstances, the state is capable of possessing at least partial moral authority to govern.  We will look at, inter alia, A.  John Simmons' version of the so-called principle of fair play, Joseph Raz's so-called service conception of authority, John Finnis \"natural law\" theory of political authority, Jeremy Waldron's version of John Rawls' theory of the duty to support just institutions, David Estlund's theory of democratic political authority, and, if there is time, Ronald Dworkin's theory of associative obligations.  In addition to examining \n\n these specific theories, we will also inquire into the more abstract set of conditions that any theory of legitimate political authority or legitimate political obligation must meet if it is to have any chance of being successful, either in whole or in part.  In this regard, the work of Leslie Green and David Copp, among others will prove particularly helpful.\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "578. (LAW 946) Topics in Political Philosophy.
