The students will be exposed to both formal didactic instruction and selected field work.  The course will cover principles in continuum and analytical mechanics, and will use application in injury research to illustrate these concepts.  The course will be divided into three major units.  The first unit will be an introduction to variational principles of mechanics and calculus of variations, and will apply these concepts to injury problems (e.g., occupant kinematics during a collision, vehicle kinematics, impact to padded surfaces).  Special emphasis will be placed on converting a system input into a body response.  The second unit of the course will be used to discuss the effect of gross body motion on tissue and organ mechanical response.  Material models of biological tissue will be discussed, and examples relating body motion to tissue response will be reviewed.

In each of these fields one would like to have a precise picture of a 2 or 3 dimensional object, which cannot be obtained directly. The data that is accessible is typically some collection of weighted averages. The problem of image reconstruction is to build an object out of the averaged data and then estimate how close the reconstruction is to the actual object. In this course we introduce the mathematical techniques used to model measurements and reconstruct images.  As a simple representative case we study transmission X-ray tomography (CT).
