We then turn to the social construction of social problems by examining how various issues become defined as social problems. This involves a consideration of the role of the media, social experts and social movements.  The last section of the course considers how social problems are addressed.  Here we discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of government programs and regulations versus market-based approached.

We will also examine studies that address how national contexts mediate social stratification.  Advanced undergraduate students will be admitted with permission.

It then considers what influences journalism, and how recent changes in the organisation and practice of journalism are affecting the welfare of society.  This is followed by an equivalent examination of what influences television drama and film.  The implications of recent developments are explored through two case studies: first, /Sex and the City/, examined partly in relation to debates within feminism and post-feminism, and second, the/Sopranos/, assessed in relation to competing interpretations of cultural value.  The course's conspectus is then broadened to take account of the way in which different countries organise their media systems, and the underlying objectives and assumptions that inform national media policies.  This leads, in turn, to a discussion of media globalisation, cultural imperialism' and international media regulation; and of the policy choices posed by the rise of new media.\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "896.
