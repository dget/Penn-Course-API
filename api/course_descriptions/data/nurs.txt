Prerequisite(s): Permission of Instructor Needed. \n\nThis course is an intensive and focused introduction to social gerontology as a trans-disciplinary lens through which to examine aspects of social structure, actions, and consequences in an aging society.  A variety of sources are employed to introduce students from any field focused on human behavior and interaction to classical notions of social gerontology and current scholarly inquiry in gerontology.  Field work in the tradition of thick description creates a mechanism to engage students in newly gerontological understandings of their life worlds and daily interactions. Weekly field work, observing aspects of age and representations of aging and being old in every day experiences forms, is juxtaposed against close critical readings of classical works in social gerontology and current research literature as well as viewings of film and readings of popular literature as the basis for student analysis.  Student participation in the seminar demands careful scrutiny and critical synthesis of disparate intellectual, cultural, and social perspectives using readings and field work and creation of oral and written arguments that extend understandings of the issues at hand in new and substantive ways.

We consider evidence that inequalities in education, income, and occupation influence health status, and the policy dilemma that broad interventions to improve population health may increase health disparities.  We critically examine whether prevention is always better than cure, and what modern medicine has to offer in terms of health.  We explore the public policy process in health using the \"tobacco wars\" as a case example, of how politics, policy, law, commercial interests, and research intersect to affect the public's health.  We examine whether global health is in a state of decline, and the extent to which failures in public health, public policy, and foreign policy have contributed to increasing threats to world health.  Likewise we will examine the potential for greater integration of health into foreign policy to create global infrastructure upon which to advance health.  We will examine the global health workforce and the impact of widespread global migration of health professionals on receiving and sending countries. \n\n There are no prerequisites.

Prerequisite(s): Permission of faculty. \n\nMillions of people of all ages live with chronic illness(es).  A diagnosis of a chronic illness is a life-changing event, causing disruption and a sense of loss for many.  Common early responses are stress, anxiety, depression, fear, and anger.  Over time, with support and experience with the illness, many adjust.  But, others report persistent feelings of loss due to physical, emotional, spiritual/existential, social, occupational, and/or financial influences of chronic illness. \n\nThose who adjust the best typically find a way to return a sense of normalcy to their lives.  Loved ones and caregivers are equally affected by chronic illness and much has been written in recent years about caregiver burden.  However, some individuals (caregivers and patients) report positive responses to illness, including a deepened purpose for living and a reordering of life priorities. \n\n The focus of this course is on individual responses to chronic illness- the person diagnosed and his/her loved ones. \n\nThis course is intended to complement N818, which focuses on families and dyads dealing with chronic illness.  In this course we will explore the major theoretical perspectives that underlie this field.  The literature describing common responses of both those diagnosed and their loved ones as well as the social and cultural context that helps explain the responses of individuals facing chronic illness will be examined.
