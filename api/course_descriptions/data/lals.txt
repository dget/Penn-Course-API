Freshman Seminar. \n\nThe civilization of the ancient Maya, which flourished between approximately 1000 B.C. and the Spanish Conquest of the sixteenth century A.D. in what is now southern Mexico and northern Central America, has long been of wide public interest.  The soaring temples of Tikal, the beautiful palaces of Palenque, the sophisticated carved monuments and sculpture, and the complex writing, astronomical, and mathematical systems of this pre-industrial civilization have been widely photographed and written about.  However, revolutionary advances in archaeological research which have provided important new data about the farmers and craftspeople who supported the great Maya rulers, and the decipherment of Maya hieroglyphics writing over the past two decades have led to the overthrow of the traditional model of Lowland Maya civilization and the growth of new understandings of the development of Lowland Maya civilization, the rise of urban states, and the successful adaptation to a difficult and varied tropical environment. \n\nThrough a series of case studies, this seminar will examine the research that has led to these new insights and will evaluate the exciting new models of Maya civilization and its achievements that have emerged in recent years.\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "032.

We will also try to determine the predicament of political art and literature in times of globalization.  We will read texts by, among others, Pablo Neruda, Julio Cortazar, Glauber Rocha, Reinaldo Arenas, Osvaldo Lamborghini, and Diamela Eltit, and analyze images of several artists, from Antonio Berni and Helio Oiticica, to Doris Salcedo and Cildo Meireles.\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "697.

The course is not a chronological journey, but rather a topical treatment of the various issues in the history of American music. Some of the specific, project-oriented activities of the course will consist of, but will not be limited to the following: (1)participating in the development of a traveling exhibition on the Apollo Theater for the SmithsonianInstitution; (2)development of a permanent website for a history of jazz course at Penn; (3)reviewing two manuscripts for publication to a major press; (4)developing a working proposal for a history of African American music.  In this context students will learn the basics of contemporary music criticism, including: identifying a work's significant musical gestures; positioning those gestures within a broader field of musical rhetoric, conventions, and social contracts; and theorizing the conventions with respect to large systems of cultural knowledge, such as historical, geographical contexts as well as the lived experiences of audiences, composers, performers, and dancers.  Other topics covered: origin and development of American popular music and gendered and racial aspects of American classical music.\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "770.
