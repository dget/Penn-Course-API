Students will conduct research into industrial design processes, both traditional and contemporary, and will adapt these processes into techniques to design a prototype for limted production.  Instruction will include; model making, the full scale production of a prototype, its detailing; design for mass production and the possibility of mass customization; design for assembly furniture case studies; software integration, 3d scanning, optimization studies; Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) and a site visit to a furniture manufacturer.\n\n(Course offered in spring term only.)", "title": "726.

(C) Owen. \n\nIndustrial design (ID) is the professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer. Industrial designers develop these concepts and specifications through collection, analysis and synthesis of user needs data guided by the special requirements of the client or manufacturer.  They are trained to prepare clear and concise recommendations through drawings, models and verbal descriptions. The profession has evolved to take its appropriate place along side Engineering and Marketing as one fo the cornerstones of Integrated Product Design teams.  The core of Industrial Design's knowledge base is a mixture of fine arts, commercial arts and applied sciences utilized with a set of priorities that are firstly on the needs of the end user and functionality, then the market and manufacturing criteria. \n\n This course will provide an overview and understanding of the theories, thought processes and metholologies employed in the daily practice of Industrial Design.  This includes understanding of ethnographic research and methodologies, product problem solving, creative visual communication, human factors / ergonomics application and formal and surface development in product scale.

Yet policy developers often treat these as unintended consequences.  And designers typically operate within the constraints created by such consequences.  But could design thinking improve policy outcomes?  Our test bed for this examination will be the relationship between energy and urban form, which presents a critical policy challenge for young professionals from many fields.  The seminar will survey current research and policy options emerging from local, regional, state, and federal governments and discuss their implications for design outcomes at the scale of buildings, neighborhoods, and regions?  None of these implications have been fully explored by policy makers at any level of government.  This seminar will explore each in turn, allowing students to develop a deep understanding of the policy content on this important issue as well as of the policy process in general.
