The selection of materials has been based on availability and functionality.  The rapid advances of materials technologies in the last 150 years, however, have made nearly all classes and forms of materials available, at a cost.  Therefore, in theory at least, materials selection can now proceed on a rational basis as an optimization process.  In this course, we will focus on two major areas of materials applications in modern world, structural applications where mechanical design is central and electronic applications where system functionality is the driver, to examine the validity of the above proposition, sometimes reaching surprising conclusions.  Issues of process integration in material selection, which feature especially prominently in electronic materials with continuing trend toward miniaturization (now down to 90 nm in commercial products), are emphasized.
