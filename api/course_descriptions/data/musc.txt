In exploring how late thirteenth-century writers and composers defined themselves as part of a tradition, we will also look back to their 'history' -- to the repertory of troubadour lyrics.  The course will place particular emphasis on the ways medieval writers and musicians construed their creations, and the many productive tensions between language and sound; singing and speaking; words and music.  We will explore how that concern with etymologies of song played out not only in the lyrics themselves, but also in theoretical writing about song, and in its manuscript representation and codification. \n\nIncluded in our discussions will be writings by Johannes de Grocheio, Philippe de Vitry, Brunetto Latini and Deschamps, and consideration of a range of chansonniers, including the Chansonnier du roi, the Montpellier codex, and the Machuat manuscripts.\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "710.

They were sometimes made by the same people, and they were often understood to have the same purpose: to attune individuals to the rhythms, proportions, and harmonies of nature.  This seminar draws connections between music, science, politics, ethics and aesthetics between 1750 and 1850, a crucial point in European history.  We will examine the role of instruments in conceptions of nature, society, and the individual, traversing the clockwork regularity of the enlightenment, the turbulent longings of Romanticism, and the spooky delirium of the fantastic. The course begins with light refracting through prisms; it ends with the blaring trombones of Berlionz's opium-induced Symphonie Fantatique; along the way we will visit ideas of mimesis, mechanical observation, theories of the passions, global science, demonic virtuosity, phantasmagoria, the uncanny, and the paradoxes of bourgeois selfhood.
