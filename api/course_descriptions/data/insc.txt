To build these neuromorphic systems, we proceed from the device level, through the circuit level, to the system level.  At the device level, we mimic electrodiffusion of ions through membrane channels with electrodiffusion of electrons through transistor channels.  At the circuit level, we derive minimal implementations of synaptic interaction, dendritic integration, and active membrane behavior.
