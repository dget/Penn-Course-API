This introductory course will survey the emergence of the scientific world view fromthe Renaissance through the end of the 20th century.  By focusing on the life, work and cultural contexts of those who created modern science, we will explore their core ideas and techniques, where they came from, what problems they solved, what made them controversial and exciting and how they related to contemporary religious beliefs, politics, art, literature, and music.  The course is organized chronologically and thematically.

The course has two principal goals: (1)to give students a practical introduction to the fundamental questions and methods of the history of medicine, and (2)to foster a nuanced, critical understanding of medicine's complex role in contemporary society.  The couse takes a broadly chronological approach, blending the perspectives of the patient,the physician,and society as a whole--recognizing that medicine has always aspired to \"treat\" healthy people as well as the sick and infirm.  Rather than history \"from the top down\"or \"from the bottom up,\"this course sets its sights on history from the inside out.  This means, first, that medical knowledge and practice is understood through the personal experiences of patients and caregivers.  It also means that lectures and discussions will take the long-discredited knowledge and treatments of the past seriously,on their own terms, rather than judging them by todays's standards.  Required readings consist largely of primary sources, from elite medical texts to patient diaries.

(B) Mills. \n\nThis course surveys the interdisciplinary field of Science and Literature Studies, with an emphasis on the modern life and physical sciences (19th century to the present).  During the first part of the semester, we will examine literary responses to science: the \"two cultures\" debate; the impact of scientific and technical changes on literary practices; representations of science in fiction.  In the second half of the course, we will consider science as literature: scientific rhetoric and standards of authorship; inscription or writing technolgies in laboratories; scientists as authors of popular literature; the impact of futurism and speculative fiction on science. Course readings will be drawn from fiction, the life and physical sciences, literary theory, and the history of science.\n\n(Course offered in spring term only.)", "title": "323.

We also explore how science has interpreted male-female differences.  Our goal is to understand the profound impact of social place in the history of science, and thereby to understand the social nature of scientific knowledge.\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "329.

Various social policies were once designed by people who had definitive views about the genetics of race.

The incorporation of science into the apparatus of the Cold War state changed the ways that scientists studied, worked, and communicated with each other and the public.  But beyond such practical concern, scientists in both the United States and the Soviet Union had to confront the question of what it meant to pursue natural knowledge in a militarized state.  No nation or politcal system could survive without the weapons, medicine, foodstuffs, and consumer producers made possible by modern scientific research--yet science was supposedly an international system free from the dicates of politics.
