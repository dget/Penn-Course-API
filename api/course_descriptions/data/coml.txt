Yet, its subversive shadow-side lurks in literary and cinematic nightmares, surrealist wanderings and stories packed with dreams.

Ox and A.B. \n\nYehoshua, the pillars of the Israeli canon, often speak in the symbolic language of the subconscious.

At the same time, research has also focused on the rupture of narrative, the inability to find appropriate forms of telling, and the experience of a loss of words.  The notion of trauma (Greek for \"wound\") may stand for such a rupture.  Many kinds of narratives, most prominently the recollections of Holocaust survivors, are instances in which memories are invoked not only to come to terms with traumatic events, but also to inscribe trauma in various ways.  In this seminar, we will read theoretical work on memory and trauma, discuss their implication for the study of literature, art, and culture, read select examples from Holocaust survivors' autobiographies (i.e.  Primo Levi, EliWiesel), and discuss visual art (i.e.  Boltanski, Kiefer) and film (i.e. Resnais, Lanzmann, Spielberg).\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "539.

(M) Richman. \n\nThe purpose of this course is to examine the various modalities of interaction between anthropology and literature in modern French culture.  Our guiding thesis is that the turn toward other cultures has functioned as a revitalizing element in the production of cultural artifacts while providing an alternative vantage point from which to examine the development of French culture and society in the contemporary period.  The impressive innovations of \"ethnosurrealism\" in the twenties and thirties by Artaud, Bataille, Caillois, and Leiris, have become acknowledged models for the postwar critical thought of Barthes, Derrida, and Foucault, as well as inspiring a renewal of \"anthropology as cultural critique\" in the U.S.  Key texts by Durkheim, Mauss and Levi-Strauss will be considered both in their own terms and in relation to their widespread influence.  The institutional fate of these intellectual crossovers and their correlative disciplinary conflicts will provide the over-arching historical frame for the course, from the turn of the century to the most recent debates.\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "604.

Focusing on the theatrical representations and cultural implications of cross-dressing in aseries of plays by Shakespeare and his contemporaries, we will explore beliefs and practices that expressed conceptions of gender and sexual difference radically different from our own.

(M) Brownlee/Copeland. \n\nFor the Middle Ages, allegory represents a nexus of literary history and textual theory, hermeneutics and theology, intellectual history and education, and theories of history and the transmission of culture.  Through medieval allegorical practices we see some of the deepest continuities with ancient hermeneutical thought and also some of the most radical ruptures with the ancient past.  Allegory, in other words, was as crucial and charged a term for medieval culture as for contemporary thought.  Allegory is at once a trope, that is, a specific and delimited form, and an all-encompassing interpretive system.  It will be the purpose of this seminar to try to articulate the connections between that particular form and that general system by examining medieval allegory in its various literary tnd philosophical contexts.

Starting from Lacan's rereading of Cartesian subjectivity and Nietzsche's dramatization of the artist as creator of values, we'll focus on Max Stirner's The Ego and His Own, seen both as a text-book for later anarchism and as Marx's and Engels's most subtle enemy (in the German Ideology).  Stirner leads to Meredith's famous novel, The Egoist, whose ethos in its turn underpins the feminist project of a Dora Marsden who chose to rename the radical magazine the New Free Woman as The Egoist.  We'll read Joyce, Pound adn Eliot in the context of the philosophy set forward by The Egoist, and then launch into a discussion of \"impersonality\" (Rimbaud, Mallarme, Eliot) and of \"masks\" of poetic \"heteronyms\" (pessoa, Pound Yeats), and conclude with Beckett's last texts, especially Not-I.\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "766.

The graduate seminar would like to explore the archeology of modernity in order to understand how, despite a desire to break up with the past and to launch the radically new, modernity appears as always haunted by specific ghosts.  One of the central issues will turn around the question of the rationality of critical discourse when it is confronted with uncanny objects such as ghosts.  From Freudian and Derridian theories to the history of postmodernity (Lyotard), we shall revisit a few monuments of modernish mourning.  We shall attempt to apprehend how an experience of loss is as crucial for Surrealism as for Joyce, yet organizes different economies of libidinal investment.  The very mourning of form as such will provide a concept with which we can start rethinking the dividing line vetween modernism proper and postmodernism which begins to assert itself with Beckett, Bernhard, and Michael Palmer.  The strong link between mourning and modernity will be shown central to all the movements that have attempted an esthetic revolution.\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "768.
