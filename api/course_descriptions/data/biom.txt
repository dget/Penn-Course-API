Prerequisite(s): BIOM 600 Cell Biology and Biochemistry. \n\nThis is the first offering of a graduate course in cellular pathology analgous to an existing medical course with the same name.  The course was designed to complement BIOM 600 Cell Biology.  This course will cover basic cellular pathology and the five basic pathological processes that underlie all diseases: cellular responses to injury, tissue response to injury, tissue repair processes, hemodynamic disorders and neoplasia.  The course consists of virtual lectures, reading assignments, and one discussion class each week. Sufficient background in immunology and genetics will be provided as it relates to pathological processes.\n\n(One-term course offered either term.)", "title": "501.

(B) Dr.  Mitch Lewis and Dr.  Carolyn Cambor. Prerequisite(s): BIOM 501 or by permission of course directors.  This course is reserved for BGS students only. BIOM 502 will provide students an in-depth look at 3-4 human diseases.  The focus will be on understanding the pathophysiology of the diseases and how research has not only enhanced our knowledge of the disease mechanisms but has also led to improved therapy for patients with these diseases.  Students will spend 2-4 weeks on each disease.  The 2007 diseases will include: diabetes, atherosclerosis, chronic myelogenous leukemia and colon cancer.  Students will follow a paradigm for learning about diseases that can be applied to the study of any disease.  They will first learn the normal anatomy, histology, and physiology of the organ(s) involved in the disease.  Then, they will learn the pathophysiology and molecular basis of each specific disease.  Finally students will discuss the research in the field and how this led to current therapeutic approaches for each disease.  Ideas for future research needed in each disease will also be explored.\n\n(Course offered in spring term only.)", "title": "502. Molecular Basis of Disease I.
