Most of the world, especially in so-called emerging economies, is still confronted with the challenge, and often pain, of creating a modern industrial capitalist society.  The course attempts to build a conceptual apparatus for understanding models of industrialization and is built around issues such as law, anti-trust, corporate forms, banking institutions, industrial relations, etc.  By definition, the course tends to concentrate on successful industrializers around the world, but questions regarding continuing underdevelopment will be addressed.\n\n(One-term course offered either term.)", "title": "107.

Europe developed from an agriculturally-based to an industrially-based economy, with attendant changes in society and culture.  From subsistence-level productivity, the European economy expanded to create great surfeits of goods, with attendant changes in consumption and expectation.  Europe grew from a regional economic system to become part--some would say the heart--of a global economy, with attendant changes in worldview and identity. \n\nEconomic intensification, expansion, globalization, and industrialization are our topics, therefore.  Beginning with economic organizations and practices, we will consider how these changed over time and influenced society and culture.

Yet, it argues outward: from the particular to the general, from the individual to the social, from the local to the global.

The grand societies and rich states which composed the European state system in 1890 destroyed themselves in these fifty-five years.

Europe's flourishing Jewish community east of the Rhine was wiped out.
