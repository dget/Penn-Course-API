The extraordinary innovations of \"ethnosurrealism\" in the twenties and thirties by such key figures of the avant-garde as Breton, Artaud, Bataille, Caillois, and Leiris, have become acknowledged models for the postwar critical thought of Barthes, Derrida, and Foucault, as well as inspiring a renewal of \"anthropology as cultural critique in the United States.\" Besides the authors just indicated, key texts by Durkheim, Mauss and Levi-Strauss will be considered both on their own terms and in relation to their obvious influence.

In literature, this obsession manifests itself most clearly in the epistolary novel, which became the privileged form of expression chosen by all the major authors of the age.  Because of the rise of epistolarity, the art of \"writing to the moment,\" in Richardson's memorable formulation, must be seen as one of the Enlightenment's principal voices. And, for the first time, the letter became a highly valued means of communication, in both the private and the public domains. \n\n We will read most of the major epistolary novels beginning with the genre's first classic, \"Lettres portugaises,\" and ending with its masterpiece, \"Liaisons dangereuses.\" We will consider some real correspondences--for example, Sevigne's and Diderot's--to see how the urge to turn them into novels proved irresistible, to editors and authors alike. \n\nFinally, we will read several examples of what was known as the \"public\" letter, philosophical texts that used the epistolary form (for example, Diderot's \"Lettre sur les aveugles\"), to see how the techniques of epistolarity survived the transition into the realm of the polemical.\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "662.
