A tenth century courtier poses as woman writing the first woman's diary.  Poets from Byron to Robert Lowell, through Ezra Pound to Li Po, have written as though, they were women, decrying their painful situations.  Is something wrong with this picture, or is \"woman\" such a fascinating position from which to speak that writers can hardly help trying it on for size?  In this course we will look at male literary impersonators of women, as well as women writers.  Our questions will include who speaks in literature for prostitutes--whose bodies are in some sense the property of men--and what happens when women inhabit the bodies of other women via spirit possession. \n\nReadings will draw on the Japanese tradition, which is especially rich in such cases, and will also include Western and Chinese literature, anthropological work on possession, legal treatments of prostitution, and film.

Besides helping to distribute economic resources within a society, families reflect societies' values, norms, tensions and power dynamics through their structure. Furthermore, changes in the family's values, functions and structures mirror changes in women's roles and experiences, both inside and outside the home. Finally, families also serve as the repository for memories from generation to generation. \n\n In this course, we will explore some central debates and issues in the history of the family by focusing on case studies from England, France, Germany, and the United States from the medieval through the modern periods.  How are families created and dissolved over time, and how did changes in these practices come about?  How did people make the decision to get married, and how important were affective ties and material considerations in this process?

We shall begin with the foundations of the \"courtly\" lyric tradition, reading the \"trobairitz\" (female troubadours).  Next we shall turn to early Italian texts in which woman is the object of a male gaze.  We shall consider both the classical \"high\" style that idolizes woman (Petrarch) and programmatic departures from it (Dante's \"Stony Rhymes,\" satirical dialogues, and humorous misogyny).  Our point of arrival will be the Petrarchan poetesses of 16th-century Europe, with an emphasis on the Italians (Vittoria Colonna, Gaspara Stampa, Laura Battiferra degli Ammannati).  What were the literary and philosophical traditions that shaped notions of female identity?  How do women establish their own textual space when appropriating a genre that had been the vehicle for a masculine first-person voice?  How do the images of women as scripted by men, or staged through male cross-voicing, differ from those in poetry written by women?
