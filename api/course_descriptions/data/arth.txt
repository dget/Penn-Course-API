Topics to be discussed include the Arts and Crafts movement, Art Nouveau, Expressionism, Art Deco, the International Style, and Post-modernism.  The debate over the role of technology in modern life and art, the search for a universal language of architectural communication, and the insistent demand that architecture serve human society are themes that will be traced throughout the course.  Among the important figures to be considered are Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius, Le Corbusier, Louis Kahn, Rovert Venturi, and Denise Scott Brown.

Encounters with the arts of Africa, Oceania and other traditions unfamiliar in the West spurred innovations in media, technique, and subject matter. \n\nArtists also began to respond to the challenge photography, to organize themselves into movements, and in some cases, to challenge the norms of art through \"anti-art.\" A new gallery system replaced traditional forms of exhibition organizers.

Yet what makes this art engaging is that it raises the question of what art is or can be, employs a range of new materials and technologies, and addresses previously excluded audiences.  It invades non-art spaces, blurs the boundaries between text and image, document and performance, asks questions about institutional frames (the museum, gallery, and art journal), and generates new forms of criticism.  Much of the \"canon\" of what counts as important is still in flux, especially for the last twenty years.  And the stage is no longer centered only on the United States and Europe, but is becoming increasingly global.

(C) Poggi. \n\nMany people experience the art of our time as bewildering, shocking, too ordinary (my kid could do that), too intellectual (elitist), or simply not as art.  Yet what makes this art engaging is that it raises the question of what art is or can be, employs a range of new materials and technologies, and addresses previously excluded audiences.  It invades non-art spaces, blurs the boundaries between text and image, document and performance, asks questions about institutional frames (the museum, gallery, and art journal), and generates new forms of criticism.  Much of the \"canon\" of what counts as important is still in flux, especially for the last twenty years.  And the stage is no longer centered only on the United States and Europe, but is becoming increasingly global.  The course will introduce students to the major movements and artists of the post-war period, with emphasis on social and historical context, critical debates, new media, and the changing role of the spectator/participant.\n\n(One-term course offered either term.)", "title": "687.

In addition to considering the possibilities and limits of genre as a category of analysis, we will grapple with a number of questions that will persist throughout the course: What is the relationship between cinema and the automobile?  Is the road trip a particularly American fantasy, and if so, what does it mean when non-U.S. filmmakers adopt the road-movie genre?  Is the road movie a \"masculine\" genre? \n\nWhat role do urban and rural spaces play in the development of the genre?  What happens to race/gender/sexuality/national identity in the road movie?
