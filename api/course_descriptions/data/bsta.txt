Prerequisite(s): Multivariable calculus and linear algebra, BSTA 620 (may be taken concurrently). \n\nThis first course in statistical methods for data analysis is aimed at first year Biostatistics degree candidates.  It focuses on the analysis of continuous data, and includes descriptive statistics, such as central tendencies, dispersion measures, shapes of a distribution, graphical representations of distributions, transformations, and testing for goodness of fit for a distribution.  Populations, samples, hypotheses of differences and equivalence, and errors will be defined.  One and two sample t-tests, analysis of variance, correlation, as well as non-parametric tests and correlations will be covered. \n\n Estimation, including confidence intervals, and robust methods will be discussed.  The relationship between outcome variables and explanatory variables will be examined via regression analysis, including single linear regression, multiple regression, model fitting and testing, partial correlation, residuals, multicolinearity.
