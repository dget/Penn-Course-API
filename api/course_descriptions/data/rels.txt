This course will deal with (1) the social and cultural foundations of health care in the modern world and (2) the ways that diversity affects and is affected by health care.  Because simplistic views of diversity reinforce stereotypes, the course necessarily recognizes that each individual belongs to more than one group--each person has a cultural background, a gender, an age, may have one or more disabilities, and so forth.  And even within groups, the experiences and needs of each individual are unique.  For example, there is no such person as \"the African-American patient\" or \"the female patient.\" Proper attention to diversity can enhance both cultural and individually appropriate care for all persons.  By dealing with these political, social and cultural aspects of diversity and health care, this course will introduce students to complex and basic issues of social construction ranging from cultural dimensions of medical ethics to the importance of differing health traditions (from folk medicine to foodways to such beliefs as the idea that AIDS is a genocidal government conspiracy).\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "519.

(M) McDaniel. \n\nSpring 2010: Buddhist Healing and Magic - Buddhist Studies is replete with controversies and contentious scholars. \n\nThese intellectual arguments and debates emerge from textual variants, logical inconsistencies, spotty hisstorical records, ethical conundrums, as well as the varied and many questions indigenous and foreign scholars have posed to themselves and the tradition.  In this course, we will explore the intellectual history of some of these controversies not necessarily to solve problems, but to understand their permutations, motivations, and contingencies.  This semester's theme will be Buddhist practices of magic and healing.  We will read about this controversial issue in the study of Buddhism drawing on workin Japanese, Thai, Tibetan, Chinese, Lao, Burmese, Cambodian, Korean, and other Buddhist traditions.  In general, this course will first review the intellectual history of the study of Buddhist magic and healing and compare and contrast that with the monastic practice and study of Buddhism in Asia.  We ask: are the same debates that pervade the \"Western\" scholarly community reflective of centuries old monastic debates or is there a great \"insider-outsider\" divide? \n\n Included in this historical approach will be a study of the influence of colonialism, globalism, and print and media technology on the study and reception of Buddhism locally and translocally.  From three major debates are investigated and critically engaged with systematically.  Scholars such as Schopen, Harrison, Payutto, Sivaraksa, Nattier, Skilling, Hirakawa, Hallisey, Satha-Anand, Trainor, Gombrich, Bizot, Obeyesekere, and Buddhadasa will be consulted.  The primary objective of this course is to provide a sophisticated approach to the study of Buddhist magic and healing (and Buddhism in general) in light of larger intellectual debates in post-colonial, textual, anthropological, cultural, and gender studies.\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "571.
