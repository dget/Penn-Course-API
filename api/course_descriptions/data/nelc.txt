All texts will be in translation from Yiddish and Hebrew, or in English.  Through a variety of genres--devotional literature, memoir, fiction, and poetry -- we will study women's roles and selves, the relation of women and men, and the interaction between Jewish texts and women's lives. The legacy of women in Yiddish devotional literature will serve as background for our reading of modern Jewish fiction & poetry from the past century.  The course is devided into five segments.  The first presents a case study of the Matriarchs Rachel and Leah, as they are portrayed in the Hebrew Bible, in rabbinic commentary, in pre-modern prayers, and in modern poems.  We then examine a modern novel that recasts the story of Dinah, Leah's daughter.  Next we turn to the seventeenth century Glikl of Hamel, the first Jewish woman memoirist.  The third segment focuses on devotional literature for and by women.  In the fourth segment, we read modern women poets in Yiddish, Hebrew, and English. \n\nThe course concludes with a fifth segment on fiction and a memoir written by women in Yiddish, Hebrew, and English.\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "154.

The translators negotiated their way between literal translation and various degrees of interpretive translation based on the different styles and idioms of Hebrew and Aramaic and considerations of theology, law, and other matters. Those targums popular in the land of Israel expanded the text considerably by introducing aggadic lore in the translation.  They were studied by the laity, exerted a strong influence on the medieval Bible commentators and are still regularly studied in some Jewish circles today.  They constitute a valuable resource for the study of the Hebrew Bible and for understanding Jewish belief, practice, and folklore.  Since the Renaissance they have also been studied by Christian scholars as an aid to understanding Scripture and as a window on Jewish belief contemporary with the early development of Christianity.
