Second, the course will sharpen students' research design skills.  The written assignments require students to take the often abstract theories presented in the readings and develop practical research designs for testing hypotheses derived from the theories.  The papers will not include data collection or the execution of actual tests.  Rather, they will focus on the conceptual problems of designing tests which eliminate competing hypotheses, operationalizing variables, and identifying potential sources of data.

(M) Sil. \n\nThis seminar is aimed primarily at graduate students planning to take doctoral exams in comparative politics.  It provides a critical survey of the field of comparative politics, tracing the intellectual history of the field, examining shifts in conceptual frameworks and research traditions, and comparing alternative methodological approaches.  The first half of the course generally examines how processes of political, economic, and social change have been theorized in the social sciences from the mid-19th century to the present.  In this process, particular attention is paid to the bifurcation between theories that emphasize the \"universal\" (e.g. the homogenizing effects of specific processes or variables) and the \"particular\" (e.g. the persistence of distinctive historical legacies and trajectories).  Since this bifurcation is reinforced by distinct styles and methods of research, the seminar also probes the recent battles between rational-choice, cultural, and structuralist scholars, while considering the trade-offs between varieties of formal, quantitative, and qualitative methods.  In the second half, the focus shifts to the range of substantive problems investigated by scholars in the field of comparative politics. \n\n These topics cover the complex relations among nations, states and societies; the origins, consolidation, and patterns of democratic governance; political economy in relation to development processes and social policies; the intersection of international/global economy and domestic politics; the dynamics of revolutions and social movements; and alternative problematiques constructed from the point of view of real actors such as workers, women, and local communities.  In all cases, As a whole, the course is designed to provide an introduction to important issues and debates that comparativists have regularly engaged in; to help you understand the assumptions behind, and differences between, particular approaches, methods, and styles of research; to examine whether current debates are spurring new or better research in a given field in light of past approaches; and to gauge whether there has been progress, fragmentation, or stagnation in the field of comparative politics as a whole.\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "610.

The readings offer an overview of the most influential theories of development and underdevelopment that structured debate from the 1960's through the 1990's,and focus on the elements of these approaches that advance understanding of development and stagnation in several key countries, including Brazil, Mexico, India and selected countries in East and Southeast Asia.\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "615.

The course foregrounds works that put gender, sex and sexuality - and with them the subject - in question.  One set of works is drawn from political and feminist theory and includes writings by Judith Butler, Lacques Lacan, Guy Hocquenham, Monique Wittig, and Nancy Fraser.  Through the use of works from comparative politics and cultural studies, the interrogation of the sexual subject reveals itself as an interrogation of political economies and political institutions.
