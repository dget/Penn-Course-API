This introductory course will survey the emergence of the scientific world view fromthe Renaissance through the end of the 20th century.  By focusing on the life, work and cultural contexts of those who created modern science, we will explore their core ideas and techniques, where they came from, what problems they solved, what made them controversial and exciting and how they related to contemporary religious beliefs, politics, art, literature, and music.  The course is organized chronologically and thematically.

The course has two principal goals: (1)to give students a practical introduction to the fundamental questions and methods of the history of medicine, and (2)to foster a nuanced, critical understanding of medicine's complex role in contemporary society.  The couse takes a broadly chronological approach, blending the perspectives of the patient,the physician,and society as a whole--recognizing that medicine has always aspired to \"treat\" healthy people as well as the sick and infirm.  Rather than history \"from the top down\"or \"from the bottom up,\"this course sets its sights on history from the inside out.  This means, first, that medical knowledge and practice is understood through the personal experiences of patients and caregivers.  It also means that lectures and discussions will take the long-discredited knowledge and treatments of the past seriously,on their own terms, rather than judging them by todays's standards.
