(C) Lindee. \n\nThis course will review major developments in biomolecular sciences and Many historians of science, technology and medicine have embraced the study of popular culture in recent years.  They have drawn on a rich literature in mainstream history, on the history of reading, of the book, of museums, of oral culture, journalism, theater, and of the mass media including radio and television.  Some have even proposed that popular culture provides insights into elite knowledge systems that are not accessible in other kinds of sources,thus privileging what is publicly known over the traditional private textual, visual and material records of the archive or museum.  In this graduate research seminar we will be exploring the relevance of the study of popular culture to the history of science, technology and medicine. Participants will write an original research paper in which they draw on popular culture as a resource for the interpretation of practices, theories and material resources in natural knowledge systems.  Readings will generally focus on surveys that explicitly discuss methods, though we will also read some primary sources possibly including science fiction texts, memoirs of patients, engineers, physicians and scientists, gee-whiz popular science books, and didactic books intended for children.\n\n(One-term course offered either term.)", "title": "510.

(M) Ensmenger. \n\nThe history of computing is about more than just the electronic digital computer.  It is the story of a wide range of human activities, scientific practices, and technological developments.  The story begins in the early 19th century with the emergence of new demands for information management -- from scientific researchers, expanding government bureaucracies, and increasingly national and international corporations.  It includes not only \"computers\" (itself a large and diverse category) but data processing, communications, and visualization technolgoeis, as well as people, practices and organizational structures.  In this course we will explore the history of computing in all of its forms and varieties. \n\nWe will situate the computer in the broader history of technology, but also consider it from the perspectives of the history of science, labor history and social history.\n\n(Course not offered every year.)", "title": "515.

We will begin with Lovejoy's Great Chain of Being and critiques brought against it, moving to classic histories of scientific ideas with a focus on \"mechanical philosophy\" followed by recent rethinkings of \"the Scientific Revolution.\" We will then visit major schools of historical interpretation: Foucault's geneaologies of knowledge and power, Marxist criticism and the Frankfurt School, Max Weber's analysis of rationalization and the values of science, along with philosophical approaches to technoscience, biopower, the state of exception and artificial life. Throughout, our guiding questions will be the relationship between scientific knowledge and institutions, practices, technologies and values, as well as the connection between local case studies and the \"big picture\" of science and technology in the modern world.
