(B) Staff. \n\nAfrica is a land of great contrasts and possesses a rich mix of scenic beauty, impressive biodiversity, many cultures, economies and interesting history. Almost completely encircled by water and home to a network of some of the world's largest and longest rivers, Africa is also home to two vast and expanding hot deserts.  While Africa contains enormous amounts of mineral wealth, it also has fifteen of the world's least developed countries.  Its climate ranges from the harsh extremes in hot deserts to the Arctic Current dominated temperate climate of the southern tip of Africa and the pleasant Mediterranean climate of North Africa. \n\n Africa's remarkable ecological diversity is unique and is an expression of the varied climates in the continent, with camels in Egypt, Goliath frogs (the largest frogs in the world) in Cameroon and the African penguins in Namibia and South Africa.  Africa has extensive fertile grasslands and lush equatorial forests, yet many of its people suffer from hunger and starvation.  Despite possessing some of the most scenic and pristine landscapes in the world, poor resource management has resulted in serious environmental problems in various parts of Africa, including air and water pollution, deforestation, loss of soil & soil fertility and a dramatic decline in biodiversity through out the continent. \n\n This course aims to explore Africa's natural environment and the impact of human activities on it.  Each semester the course will offer an overview of Africa's environment as it relates to one of the following two topics 1) Water issues; 2)Environmental impact of development projects, natural resource extraction and consumption.  Each semester, in addition to analyzing one of the above topics, we will pick a couple of case studies from within the US that can be used to show parallels between some of the issues discussed in the African case studies.  The students will be asked to conduct research on a relevant topic in any region in Africa for a paper due at the end of the semester.\n\n(Course offered in spring term only.)", "title": "620.

(C) Feierman. \n\nThis graduate seminar explores the literature of African history while trying to find ways to understand history which happens on unfamiliar social and cultural terrain.  The terrain is unfamiliar because the words professional historians use, and the underlying assumptions about social process, show the marks of many generations of writing about Europe.  The standard histories, then, are torn between describing events in terms of European social process, in which case they do violence to the history, or finding a historical language which is closer to being locally grounded but unfamiliar to a western audience.  In this course we study a number of core issues of social process. Each one is meant to direct attention to a complex of local social forms, and each is at the heart of a major body of writings of African history.  A tentative list of topics includes the following: Oral tradition; knowledge and identity; ecology and ethnicity; forms of local authority and state power; ritual, conquest, and the transformation of political authority; political economy; gender and personal dependency; the ecological history of disease; popular associations and the state; the local bases of nationalism.\n\n(One-term course offered either term.)", "title": "630.

The seminar explores the rich history of interactions between followers of African Traditional Religions (ATRs) and the world religions of Islam and Christianity on the continent of Africa, from the 18th to the 20th centuries.  We pay particular attention to the religious traditions Africans brought to the encounter with Islam and Christianity and the new meanings they infused into them.  Religion is a central dimension of African history not only for earlier eras and world views, but especially in recent times when forces internal and external to the continent are competing for its spiritual, political, and economic control. Islam and Christianity are growing faster in Africa than any other continent. Multiple and hybrid religious identities are being formed everywhere on the continent, driven by the global pull of evangelical Christianity and political Islam and influenced by the global African Diaspora.  This course will examine the causes, dynamics, and processes of religious changes in Africa both through the works of scholars who have written about them and through the examination of available primary sources.\n\n(One-term course offered either term.)", "title": "650.
