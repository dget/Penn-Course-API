McInerney. \n\nThe Greeks enjoy a special place in the construction of western culture and identity, and yet many of us have only the vaguest notion of what their culture was like.  A few Greek myths at bedtime when we are kids, maybe a Greek tragedy like Sophokles' Oidipous when we are at school: these are often the only contact we have with the world of the ancient Mediterranean.  The story of the Greeks, however, deserves a wider audience, because so much of what we esteem in our own culture derives from them: democracy, epic poetry, lyric poetry, tragedy, history writing, philosophy, aesthetic taste, all of these and many other features of cultural life enter the West from Greece. The oracle of Apollo at Delphi had inscribed over the temple, \"Know Thyself.\" For us, that also means knowing the Greeks.  We will cover the period from the Late Bronze Age, c.  1500 BC, down to the time of Philip of Macedon, c.  350 BC, concentrating on the two hundred year interval from 600-400 BC.\n\n(Course offered in fall term only.)", "title": "026.

Whereas the great achievements of the Greeks were in the realm of ideas and concepts (democracy, philosophy, art, literature, drama) those of the Romans tended to be in the pragmatic spheres of ruling and controlling subject peoples and integrating them under the aegis of an imperial state. \n\nConquest, warfare, administration, and law making were the great successes of the Roman state.  We will look at this process from its inception and trace the formation of Rome's Mediterranean empire over the last three centuries BC; we shall then consider the social, economic and political consequences of this great achievement, especially the great political transition from the Republic (rule by the Senate) to the Principate (rule by emperors).  We shall also consider limitations to Roman power and various types of challenges, military, cultural, and religious, to the hegemony of the Roman state.

Traditionally the complex relationship between Greece and Rome has been seen from the Roman point of view, emphasizing the changes in Roman culture as a result of Rome's contact with the Greeks.  This class takes a different approach, considering the impact on Greece.  We will use the results of archaeological survey and excavation to chart the economic transformation of Greece, especially in relation to the Roman colony at Korinth.  This will involve examining changes in land distribution, the growth of road networks, and the increase in large public works such as theatres, aqueducts and baths.  We will also use writers such as Dio Chrysostom and Pausanias to consider the effect on the institutions of the traditional Greek city-state of being incorporated into a single province, Achaia.

In this class we will examine the achievements of Athens in its Golden Age, beginning with the Persian Wars, seminal events that saw the Greeks defeat the numercially superior Persians. In the generation that followed, Athens rapidly transformed the alliance of Greek states dedicated to taking the war back to Persia into an Aegean empire, dominated b y the Athenians and their fleet.  At the same time, this dramatic in power and prestige was accompnaied by the growth of fill participatory democracy.  We examine the daily working of that democracy, asking how an Athenian was trained for citizenship.  What did democracy mean in practice? What did freedom and autinomy mean to a society that relied on slaves and was ruthless in its treatment of its subject?  In order to answer these questions we juxtapose the breathtaking accomplishments of the Athenians, in fields such as philosophy, tragedy, comedy, sculpture and architecture, with the exclusion of women from public life, the torture and abuse of slaves, and the execution of other Greek populations. \n\n We will follow them from the height of their power to defeat at the hands of the Spartans.
